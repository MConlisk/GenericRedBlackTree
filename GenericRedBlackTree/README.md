Red-Black Tree Documentation

Introduction:

The Red-Black Tree is a self-balancing binary search tree that maintains balance by ensuring that the height of the tree is always logarithmic. It achieves this by applying specific rules to the tree structure and performing rotations when necessary. By understanding the structure and functionality of a Red-Black Tree, you can leverage its self-balancing properties to efficiently store and retrieve key-value pairs.


Code Highlights

GenericRedBlackTree<TValue>:

The GenericRedBlackTree<TValue> class represents a Red-Black Tree with a generic value type. It implements the IGenericRedBlackTree<TValue> interface. Here is the code to generate the class:

GenericNode<TValue>:

The GenericNode<TValue> class represents a node in a generic Red-Black Tree used to store key-value pairs. It implements the IGenericRedBlackNode<int, TValue> interface. 


Conclusion:

In this documentation, we have explored the implementation of a Red-Black Tree in C# using the Markdown language. We have covered the main classes and methods involved in working with a Red-Black Tree. The GenericRedBlackTree<TValue> class represents the Red-Black Tree itself, while the GenericNode<TValue> class represents the nodes within the tree.
